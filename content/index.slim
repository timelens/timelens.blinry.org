h2 Cool, what's this?

p Timelens is an Open Source project for creating <em>visual timelines</em>. Try hovering over/tapping on the timeline!

.timelens-standalone data-id="nemo" data-duration="5786"

p Visual timelines show you the <em>structure</em> of a video at a glance, by visualizing its color development. We think this makes video navigation <strong>more efficient, precise, and active</strong>.

p You can use the <code>timelens</code> command line program to generate these timelines yourself, and choose from a range of plugins to integrate them with existing video players.
